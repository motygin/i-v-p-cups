#summary Notes on installation of the set of virtual printers through a CUPS backend.

= Introduction =

For providing CUPS _ps-vprinter_ backend one has to add as root the script _ps-vprinter_ to /usr/lib/cups/backend directory and change permissions:

chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/ps-vprinter

(on some systems it should be chmod 1755 â€¦, see stat --format=%a /usr/lib/cups/backend/scsi)

Besides, add the script _virtprintd_ to some directory in the PATH, for example to /usr/local/bin and chmod +x /usr/local/bin/virtprintd

If you are going to use virtual printers to print (save) to djvu, pdf or ps files, then add the scripts printkit_djvu, printkit_pdf, printkit_ps to some directory in the PATH, for example to /usr/local/bin and

chmod +x printkit_djvu

chmod +x printkit_pdf

chmod +x printkit_ps

It is highly recommended to install the program gtklp. Being installed as CUPS backend through the virtual printer, it gives a uniform approach to your printer from all applications.  

For creation of output file _ps-vprinter_ needs a general postscript PPD file (it is better if it supports colour output). The standard /usr/share/cups/model/Postscript-level2.ppd can be used if it exists. If no, or for better result it can be useful to add to /usr/share/cups/model the PPD file from _cups-pdf_ (further CUPS-PDF.ppd) or the free AdobeTM Distiller ppd file from
http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/printerdrivers/win/all/ppdfiles/adobe.zip

= Setting the CUPS printers =

It can be done through the Web interface _http://localhost:631/admin_ or a command-line program called _lpadmin_:

To add the CUPS PDF virtual printer using CUPS-PDF.ppd do as root 

lpadmin -p Save_as_PDF -v ps-vprinter:/pdf -E
-P /usr/share/cups/model/CUPS-PDF.ppd -D "Print to a PDF file"
-L "Interactive PDF Backend via /usr/lib/cups/backend/ps-vprinter"

To add the CUPS PS virtual printer using CUPS-PDF.ppd do as root
 
lpadmin -p Save_as_PS -v ps-vprinter:/ps -E
-P /usr/share/cups/model/CUPS-PDF.ppd -D "Print to a PS file"
-L "Interactive PS Backend via /usr/lib/cups/backend/ps-vprinter"

To add the CUPS DJVU virtual printer using CUPS-PDF.ppd do as root

lpadmin -p Save_as_DJVU -v ps-vprinter:/djvu -E
-P /usr/share/cups/model/CUPS-PDF.ppd -D "Print to a DJVU file"
-L "Interactive DJVU Backend via /usr/lib/cups/backend/ps-vprinter"

To add gtklp as the CUPS printer using CUPS-PDF.ppd do as root 

lpadmin -p <NameOfYourPrinter>_via_gtklp -v "ps-vprinter:/printer-><NameOfYourPrinter>" 
-E -P /usr/share/cups/model/CUPS-PDF.ppd 
-D "Print to <NameOfYourPrinter> via gtklp" 
-L "Print to printer <NameOfYourPrinter> via gtklp"

Here <NameOfYourPrinter> is the name of your printer device (e.g. Xerox_3250) in CUPS (see _lpstat -a_)

Now in any print dialog we should have printers
Save_as_DJVU,  Save_as_PDF,  Save_as_PS, <NameOfYourPrinter>_via_gtklp

Note that when printing through printkit_pdf, printkit_djvu it is possible to add files to existing ones.

Alternative way of installation:

One can also use 

sh ./install.sh 

as root for automatic installation. The script installs all scripts, the backend, and sets djvu, pdf, and ps virtual printers in CUPS with CUPS-PDF.ppd.

Running the daemon:

Interaction with user is organized through the daemon script _virtprintd_ which should be run with the rights of user.

A simple way to invoke the daemon is to add "/usr/local/bin/virtprintd start &" to autostart of your DE (kde, xfce,...)

To stop the daemon use the command virtprintd stop
